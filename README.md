This flutter app shows the first 15 pokemons of the pokeAPI.

It's possible to create you own pokemons using the inside form in the app. The pokemon information will be saved until you restart the app.

This app uses Flutter BLoC for state managment and Dio for http requests.

Some other packages were used for a better quality of life during development.
